[Play the game here](http://zvoryg.in/FightMaestro) or watch a [demo on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3731WOsEBA).

If you dont have Myo, you can play the game using `asdfg`.

Send attacks towards your enemies using gestures! Be careful though, each type of enemy is only vulnerable to one type of attack, a fireball, green lightning ball, or rock attack. Fight your way to a ludicrous high score!

Created for Eng+Math hack at UWaterloo.
